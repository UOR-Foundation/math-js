# Math-JS Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the math-js library according to the repo-spec.md and lib-spec.md specifications. The project has been organized into a milestone with 11 well-defined issues, properly labeled and with dependencies established between them.

## Milestone: v1.0.0 Initial Implementation

### Core Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Utils module (#5)**
   - Helper functions for efficient arithmetic operations
   - Fast exponentiation algorithms
   - Divisibility checks
   - Error handling utilities

2. **Implement Factorization module (#3)**
   - Algorithm for prime factorization via trial division
   - Support for more advanced algorithms for large numbers
   - Efficient storage and representation of prime factorizations
   - Optimizations for special cases

3. **Implement Conversion module (#4)** - *Depends on #3 and #5*
   - Functions to convert between UniversalNumber and standard representations
   - Base conversion utilities (toString with base parameter)
   - Parsing functions for various input formats
   - Round-trip verification to ensure data integrity

4. **Implement PrimeMath module (#2)** - *Depends on #3*
   - Static arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, pow)
   - GCD and LCM functions
   - Prime number utilities (isPrime, nextPrime)
   - Error handling for invalid operations

5. **Implement UniversalNumber class (#1)** - *Depends on #3, #4, and #5*
   - Constructor & factory methods
   - Prime factorization storage
   - Arithmetic methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide, pow)
   - Utility methods (isIntrinsicPrime, gcd, lcm)
   - Conversion methods (toBigInt, toNumber, toString)
   - Internal methods to enforce canonical representation

### Testing Tasks

6. **Implement tests for UniversalNumber (#6)** - *Depends on #1*
   - Unit tests for all constructor methods and factory functions
   - Tests for arithmetic operations with various inputs
   - Tests for utility methods (isIntrinsicPrime, gcd, lcm)
   - Tests for conversion methods
   - Edge case testing (very large numbers, special values like 0 and 1)

7. **Implement tests for PrimeMath module (#7)** - *Depends on #2*
   - Tests for all static arithmetic functions
   - Tests for GCD and LCM functions
   - Tests for prime number utilities
   - Tests for error handling in invalid operations

8. **Implement tests for Conversion module (#8)** - *Depends on #4*
   - Tests for converting between UniversalNumber and standard representations
   - Tests for base conversion utilities
   - Tests for parsing various input formats
   - Round-trip conversion tests to ensure data integrity

### Documentation Tasks

9. **Create API documentation (#9)** - *Depends on all implementation tasks*
   - Complete JSDoc annotations for all functions and classes
   - Documentation for parameter types, return types, and possible exceptions
   - Clear and concise descriptions of all public methods
   - Examples demonstrating proper usage

10. **Create usage examples (#10)** - *Depends on all implementation tasks*
    - Basic examples of creating and using UniversalNumber
    - Examples of arithmetic operations
    - Examples of conversion between different number formats
    - Examples of using the PrimeMath utilities

### Infrastructure Tasks

11. **Set up NPM package publishing (#11)** - *Depends on all other tasks*
    - Setting up GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and publishing
    - Configuring package.json for proper NPM publishing
    - Setting up versioning and release process
    - Adding appropriate NPM ignore files

## Implementation Approach

The developer should follow this logical workflow:

1. Start with the foundational modules (Utils and Factorization)
2. Move to the dependent modules (Conversion and PrimeMath)
3. Implement the core UniversalNumber class
4. Create tests for each module as they're completed
5. Finalize documentation and examples
6. Set up NPM package publishing

This structured approach will ensure a robust, well-tested implementation that fully adheres to the specifications in the repo-spec.md and lib-spec.md documents.

## Tracking

All issues are tracked in the GitHub repository under the "v1.0.0 - Initial Implementation" milestone with appropriate labels:
- core-implementation
- testing
- documentation
- infrastructure

Dependencies between issues are documented as comments on each issue to create a clear workflow.
